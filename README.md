# A.R.ViewFinder
An application that renders augmented reality (A.R) views on a camera view of geo-location data acquired from external data sources.

The application is part of a thesis written by myself, Masitano Sichone as partial fulfilment of partial fulfilment of the Degree of [Master of Science in E-Business (Information Systems) programme](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/e-business-information-systems-msc/#profile) whilst studying at Newcastle University.

The thesis also got the [Best Dissertation Award](https://storage.googleapis.com/reinventory/masitano/Best%20Dissertation%20Award.pdf) for the 2016-2017 cohort.

External data came from [Urban Observatory](https://newcastle.urbanobservatory.ac.uk/).

To run this project you will need an API key from Urban Observatory and to have setup your own firebase project as described in the thesis Appendix C.

The aim of this project was to design and develop a mobile application that will use a mobile phoneâ€™s internal sensors to determine its geographic position and render an augmented reality view over the camera view displaying geographically related information obtained from an external data source. 

To accomplish the aim of the project the following objectives were achieved
1. Research current literature on AR, Android Application Programming Interface (API), and databases as well as representation formats of data.
2. Research and review three (3) AR applications currently available to analyse design, functionality and operations to gain insight into their trends, pros and cons.
3. Analyse geo-location information from Urban Observatory project and other external data sources to gain insight into data structures, formats & methods of manipulation.
4. Design and develop the prototype AR application that can display geo-location related information.
5. Test and evaluate the prototype AR application functionality against requirement design specifications.
6. Perform quantitative research on AR systems to identify what users look for and thereasons why they look for it as well as what they perceive will have value or not.
7. Build a Business Model for an AR application demonstrating the commercial viability of A.R systems.
